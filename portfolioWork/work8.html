            <p> In this theme I have learned how to collaborate with a big group of people for providing the best outcome.  This project,  <a href="http://ingeniousneuron.com/putinAnimation/index.html"> Superputin </a>, focused on making an animation ourselves from the very beginning and much planning was needed. Throughout the process I had the chance to use once again chaining events in Javascript, but this time, it was more complex with hiding and showing elements, as well as triggering audio once with the specific events. </p>

            <p> The screencast provides explanations for the whole process of creating SuperPutin, which is why it is so relevant. Not only we got to exercise our skills on Adobe Premiere Pro and content creation but also we had to think of a way of presenting this as clear as possible so anyone can understand what path this project has taken. </p>
