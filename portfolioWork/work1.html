            <p> In the first theme we were introduced to Photoshop and Illustrator things which I have used in my advantage to create the logo. This is a key element for every website owner which must be very suggestive to be able to transmit the identity of that particular company, or in my case myself. This is the reason why I have stepped out from the doodle style and went for a more Deconstructivism type of art. </p>
