            <h3> Javascript Project Pools </h3>
            <p> The project pool submissions were extremely important because Javascript is very different from HTML or CSS as it is a programming language itself. It has several frameworks and libraries and the very basis of website interactivity ( excluding animations and transforms done through CSS ) stands in Javascript. Unfortunately, I do believe that for understanding Javascript you should have previous knowledge in other programming languages as C# or C++ and a lot of exercise behind.</p>
            <h3>
                03.03.03 Project Pool 1
            </h3>
            <p> A small interactive piece of work, <a href="http://ingeniousneuron.com/smackFly/index.html"> “Smack the Fly” </a> , put my Javascript knowledge to test, to be more precise connecting audio with events that set attributes and remove classes as well as letting the fly randomly move across the screen through the Math Javascript object. </p>
            <h3>
                03.03.04 Project Pool 2
            </h3>
            <p> The <a href="http://ingeniousneuron.com/randomSVG/index.html"> “Random SVG” </a> was a bit more challenging  as it has thought me how to create elements through a unique identifier of the namespace. It was really useful to figure out how I can set the attribute of the inner width of the elements randomly and how to move them around through a for loop. All in all, I have had the chance to learn in a more detailed manner about how Javascript actually works. </p>
            <h3>
                Project Pool Extra
            </h3>
            <p> The <a href="http://ingeniousneuron.com/calculator/index.html"> “Calculator” </a> was a pretty easy exercise as it has required connecting functions with buttons and was based on basic mathematic calculations. It was more oriented to connecting HTML elements with the script and it was very useful as well. </p>
